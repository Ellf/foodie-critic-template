# Foodie Critics Teachable Template

This template is provided 'as-is' and no warranty of any kind it provided. By installing and using this template and associated code, including HTML, CSS, Liquid and JavaScript, you agree to this.

## Installation steps

1. Download the zip file
2. Unzip the file to a folder of your choice
3. Open the folder to view the 11 'sections' and this readme file (any other files/folders are not needed).
4. Open the first HTML file (you can use a text editor for this - it's not recommended to use Word)
5. Create a new sales page on your Teachable school. This can be either a custom page or a course page.
6. If the page has default blocks, delete these blocks but clicking the three dot on the right and selecting 'delete' from the menu. Confirm.
7. Click on 'Add New Block'
8. Select 'Custom HTML'

NOTE: If you do not see the Custom HTML block as an option, Teachable support will need to turn this on for you. Open a support chat or ticket and ask for the Custom HTML block to be turned on.

9. Copy the contents of the first html file to the first block of your Teachable sales page.
10. It is recommended to rename this new block to match the naming convention from our template. To do this, click on the three dots and pick 'rename' - use '1-script-style' (no need to add .html)
11. Repeat this process for all the other blocks.
12. Once done, it's up to you to be brave and update all the copy and images with your own.

NOTE: The 1-script-styles.html file holds a single Liquid Variable - this is on line 20 and reads:

`{% assign checkoutLink = "https://google.com" %}`

Simply change this to your own checkout link and it will be replaced throughout your template.
